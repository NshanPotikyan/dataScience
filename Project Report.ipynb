    "**Background**<br/>\n",
    "One of the Insurance companies in Armenia seeks to come up with a better pricing model for Motor Third Party Liability(MTPL) Insurance product, because the current pricing principle leaves the company without any profit. The company has collected large amounts of data concerning the riskiness of its clients throughout years and now wants to use it for improving the premium rating methodology. The premium paid by the customer consists of the net premium, which is the expected claim amount and additional terms to cover expenses etc. The senior management of the company believes that the data they have can be used to estimate the net premium given the profile of the policyholder.<br/>  \n",
    "**<font color='black'>Business goals</font>** <br/> The goals of the company is to attract new customers due to competitive prices, receive sufficient income to be able to meet its obligations in the future and to maximize the profit of the company.<br/>\n",
    "**<font color='black'>Business success criteria</font>** <br/>\n",
    "The results will be measured with the net loss ratio, which is the ratio of the paid claims and the collected premiums. The task will be considered succeeded if the loss ratio is close to 1. "
